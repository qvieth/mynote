# Draft

- Please add more discussion on the similarities and distinctiveness between this book and other
critical works in the field of medical anthropology by
(1) incorporating more research by Janis
Jenkins, Junko Kitanaka, Tom Widger, and X Marsilli-Vargas, as the reviewer suggested, and
jj(2)
elaborating on the distinction between ethnography conducted at the national level and that at the
city level. In addition, please consider whether China should be categorised as part of the Global
South, as this remains debatable.

```keep this part no more than 5 lines
- want to good at something? PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!
- if you can't categorize, tag the ideas, you're not understanding it
- do project(program) along category(package) <- intermediate packets
workflow -> write lessons in vim -> move the most important points into ~/v 
write lessons in vim is a must do -> it's help me to think (think of days that i skip d:quickjkjoing this because of being lazy
the learning progress is becoming stagnant
