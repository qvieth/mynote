## climate data class:
- FOCUS ON THE DATA first, after understand where the data is missing, then load the data into the code, then edit the code with deepseek
- start from project 1 to 5, one at a time, to see progression
- try to describe the dat
- after got the file from antigravity: use this to compare with the orignal file, ask what changes have been made, how to explain the main differences i made compare to the original file to my professor
- workflow to do:
  - keep opening the google collab, also check the scoretable and final result picture
  - try to open which "one" part of the code in charge of generate the plot
  - understand that and put it to the python
  - edit the python -> may be the most important is the data
  - after get the data, generate the chart and see what missing
  - edit with AI -> finally run with nvim -> don't focus on nvim too early
  - capture and submit
  - che

- BTC:
  - what skills do you need questions:
    - Mixed-Methods Research: To integrate quantitative (farmer surveys, service metrics) and qualitative (interviews, stakeholder mapping) data.
      - Global Climate Change" - WEI-TING CHEN -> i found this course will give me more context at high level like the course climate change and issue i took in the fall semester. but this course expect this course will have a higher level concept on global scale, with more context and 
      - "Climate change and extreme events - machine learning hands-on" - YU-CHIAO LIANG and MIN-HUI LO -> mention something about statistical and machine learning skill
      - "Introductory Statistics for Geosciences" - Department of Geosciences i also consider this course to the machine learning course above, but this will also give me concepts of geosciences, this will be useful for me for comprehensive understanding of earth system
      - "Computer Intensive Statistics in Ecology" - Available to Earth System Science, Oceanography, and other departments - i hope to achive the cocmputer skill and statistics skill in relate to ecology or biodiversity,...




- thesis:
  - try to frame: i'm focusing more on communication side rather than modelling -> as the audience (professors) will have background in atmospheric science so when talking about research about climate service try to frame it i'm about social science so it's more about social or communication side rather than doing modeling
  - 3 core inquiries:
    - 
  - data
    - primary data: unique year panel survey data colletion
    - what are climate services, temperture, precipitation - climate information - what are climate **variable** you are looking at.
      - salinity data: ob tain from 27 salinity stations from 20.. to 20.. obtain from southern center for hydro-meteological forecast center in VN
      - precipitation data: obatain from AgERA5
      - study on use of digital tools in rice farming: quantitative study survey farmers and field agent regarding use of digital tech for farming advice  -> info on digital tool use(tv/radio, phonecalls, messaging apps like zalo, fb messenger,..)
      - acbs(agro-climatic bulletins) implementation: service based on continuous data input which has been foramlly institutionalized in VN -> provide locally reccomendation based on seasonal, monthly, 10-days forecast
  - criteria for what a efficient climate servicd is
  - [done] remove typhoon
  - critical gap -> make more concrete
  - between slide 8 and 9: explain why you focus on multi level
  - explain why more...
  - explain **who** is providing climate services
  - remove the slide of how i'm gonna analyze the data
- plan when in vn
  - next summer => 3 months holiday => collect data
  - must be really ready
  - use this winter write a better proposal in spring early next year -> then in spring apply for research grant -> apply in spring will be less competitive
  - do something easy to explain
  - EASY TO UNDERSTAND AVOID VAGUE
  - in 2nd year => must have preliminary result

- priority:
  - ARC: done
  - health report: done
  - so basically all the class will have report
    - climate data          -> code         5 projects
    - climate issue         -> final report
    - seminar               -> final report
    - climate service class -> group report
  - climate service class
  - thesis presentation
  - cliamte data class
  - bike

- thesis:
  - stakeholder too much
  - hypothesis?

- climate service group report:
  - move psmc report to after the tmsc of abrar, mention it also how it is related to ifrs and tnfd framework
  - PSMC brief concerns on the background also

- ask for every project what kind of data
- what importnat right now is to understand tccip data
  - go to their website. understand how the data is
- project 1:
  - ntucool ->
  - target -> edit code_full
  - example -> code + data -> requirement -> what important is the figure
  - requirement <-> figure
- scoretable for project 1
  - max 16:
    - add labels
    - add title
  - max 18:
    - add regression line
    - t-test
  - max score 20:
    - climate spiral or change variable
- datasets

folder/photo

- the photo collage part will use all the photo in the photo folder
- the publication part use the name in list mode, don't use the table mode.




- v1
- prof website:
  - nav bar should be translate as well | also should blur and transparent like the website i gave
  - photo album collage before contact section
  - contact should have a google map view include
  - supervision part should be more well spaced, the 4 steps should have a line that connect to show the process
  - current students should in card mode with avatar of the students

- v2
  - navbar section now lost the section it point to
  - maps part should point to Global Change Centre National Taiwan University No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd. Taipei 10617 Taiwan
  - publication part, after each research ppaer titile should be pdf icon, if click in will download the pdf of that paper
  - the photo collage should as a whole doesn't leave out empty square
  - font design philosophy from title to content should follow best design principle. try use minimal and clean font like apple use, try use some color for block between section to easier to regconize at which section has past, still follow the minial and clean desgin principle, use color that fall in black white gray clean pallete

- for each:
  - similarities
  - distinction
  - search in the book review where is it.
  - then try to incorporate that smoothly in that book review

- things i need:
  - a bag for putting all the cable
  - buy 2:  usbC to C port: for ps5 dock charger
  - ally z1e:
    - C to many C for charge and connect to MAC for steam link share
    - ethernet port
    - >> laern how to do steam share
  - 
- NOW MAKE INCORPORATING AND COMPARING/ DISTINCITONING TWO AUTHORS,... LESS BECOME REPETITIVE. CHANGE WORDS

- Please add more discussion on the similarities and distinctiveness between this book and other
critical works in the field of medical anthropology by
(1) incorporating more research by Janis
Jenkins, Junko Kitanaka, Tom Widger, and X Marsilli-Vargas, as the reviewer suggested, and
jj(2)
elaborating on the distinction between ethnography conducted at the national level and that at the
city level. In addition, please consider whether China should be categorised as part of the Global
South, as this remains debatable.


- DS form revision fill looks good
- add a top paragraph mention I added 8 paragraph in total => point out the number of the paragraph
- fill in the form


- cliamte service class guess speaker
  - climate change research in NCDR
  - NCDR: national science and technology center for disaster reduction -> national think tank
  - how to estimate adaption options
  - NSTC: national science and technolgy council
  - taiwan have capicity to deal with disaster?
  - impact important but what kind of impacts?
  - tccip : there is a team inside downscale data to taiwan
    - more detail impact system
  - stakeholders:
    - government: water resources agency
    - coordinating team: NCDR
    - academic support: RCEC, academia sinica, universities
  - applications: also different stakeholders, -> how to translate the data to these
  - tccip IV research teams and topics
  - in ocean taiwan only have 7 station while rainfall more than 7 hundres
  - taiwan choose 2 degree scenarios
  - TaiESM
  - NaMR: national academy of marine research
  - scenario -> impact -> adaptation : adaption is most important
  - Question pop out while listening: learn from organiztion of taiwan to locate vietnam networks, ways of adaptation
  - compound, cascading diasters
  * national adaption framwork -> a slide of how to adapt
  - mitigation 1% still depends on 99% from other coutnry but adaptation is not 
    - customized portal: for various users -> domain specialist: adatation resources for...
    - regulation: standard method for unify differnt way, -> help compare differnt way..
    - cliame change specialist: consider scenarios in future projection for a project in addtion to current time consideration from different specialist

  - send report to professor every saturday
  - goo

- ideas sharing:
  - good starting point: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-need-to-do-research-about-cl-nVtr6gXkQ8.LruKrrtvuag#0

- learn about something, actively search for news, real case for example
- transcription model: TODO
  - improve accuracy
  - more detail(number, )
  - explain how did i come up with this results
    - so i 
  - focus on one dimension, dig deeper, focus on one or two
  - more paper
  - explain figure 1 more

- transcription:
  - check words, findlink

- interview with RTI:
  - potential market for carbon credit verification 3rd party man power: need to go to developing country to verify
- next week present

- what topic
- context
- issue, why important => research question
- theory
  - 1 concept should be enough
- don't explain method

* question from monday class could use for the thesis: Using a specific, real-world example, illustrate the social or historical mechanisms that systematically place certain groups at a disproportionately greater risk.

## principles
[writing](riting)

---
```keep this part no more than 5 lines
- want to good at something? PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!
- if you can't categorize, tag the ideas, you're not understanding it
- do project(program) along category(package) <- intermediate packets
workflow -> write lessons in vim -> move the most important points into ~/v 
write lessons in vim is a must do -> it's help me to think (think of days that i skip d:quickjkjoing this because of being lazy
the learning progress is becoming stagnant
```
