folder/photo

- the photo collage part will use all the photo in the photo folder
- the publication part use the name in list mode, don't use the table mode.




- v1
- prof website:
  - nav bar should be translate as well | also should blur and transparent like the website i gave
  - photo album collage before contact section
  - contact should have a google map view include
  - supervision part should be more well spaced, the 4 steps should have a line that connect to show the process
  - current students should in card mode with avatar of the students

- v2
  - navbar section now lost the section it point to
  - maps part should point to Global Change Centre National Taiwan University No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd. Taipei 10617 Taiwan
  - publication part, after each research ppaer titile should be pdf icon, if click in will download the pdf of that paper
  - the photo collage should as a whole doesn't leave out empty square
  - font design philosophy from title to content should follow best design principle. try use minimal and clean font like apple use, try use some color for block between section to easier to regconize at which section has past, still follow the minial and clean desgin principle, use color that fall in black white gray clean pallete

- for each:
  - similarities
  - distinction
  - search in the book review where is it.
  - then try to incorporate that smoothly in that book review

  - 
- NOW MAKE INCORPORATING AND COMPARING/ DISTINCITONING TWO AUTHORS,... LESS BECOME REPETITIVE. CHANGE WORDS

- Please add more discussion on the similarities and distinctiveness between this book and other
critical works in the field of medical anthropology by
(1) incorporating more research by Janis
Jenkins, Junko Kitanaka, Tom Widger, and X Marsilli-Vargas, as the reviewer suggested, and
jj(2)
elaborating on the distinction between ethnography conducted at the national level and that at the
city level. In addition, please consider whether China should be categorised as part of the Global
South, as this remains debatable.

    - government: water resources agency
    - coordinating team: NCDR
    - academic support: RCEC, academia sinica, universities
  - applications: also different stakeholders, -> how to translate the data to these
  - tccip IV research teams and topics
  - in ocean taiwan only have 7 station while rainfall more than 7 hundres
  - taiwan choose 2 degree scenarios
  - TaiESM
  - NaMR: national academy of marine research

  * national adaption framwork -> a slide of how to adapt
  - mitigation 1% still depends on 99% from other coutnry but adaptation is not

## principles
[writing](riting)

---
```keep this part no more than 5 lines
- want to good at something? PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!
- if you can't categorize, tag the ideas, you're not understanding it
- do project(program) along category(package) <- intermediate packets
workflow -> write lessons in vim -> move the most important points into ~/v 
write lessons in vim is a must do -> it's help me to think (think of days that i skip d:quickjkjoing this because of being lazy
the learning progress is becoming stagnant
```
