- while doing literature review, i realize there are many limitation, while searching for the name of article related to my research case, if i use deep reasoning model to search for the name, they might come up with imagine name. so combine many search way would be the best

steps to come up with good result:

don't create structure first and find paper, now find top paper , summarize them then ask chatgpt create logic based on these paper

steps to ask:
ask: i'm doing literature review about culture of prediction in the context of climate service in rice farming in mekong delta. what are some good paper i should take a look o
take all the name and organize into excel sheet
validate whether the name is real with google scholar
ask: i'm doing research about climate service in rice farming in mekong delta. i'm doing literature review about culture of prediction. i will send you research paper names. help me pick out the argument from that paper that would help me with my literature review. summarize that in one short paragraph
should 2 two instance of messege one for normal and one for below..
sub question: note that i send you paper to summary, and these paper don't have to relate to each other, you just need to summarize it relate to my research only.
